    "text": "The reactive graph\nIn the last section we built a simple shiny app which allowed the user to filter a dataframe and display some plots. One thing you might notice about the code which genrated this application is that while we specify what should happen in response to a user’s action, we don’t actually specify when it should happen. We don’t have anything like cllback functions which define when a calculation should be run, so how does Shiny know when to run the code to keep everything up to date?\nShiny is different from many other frameworks because it is declarative. Instead of specifying when code should run, you specify recipes for creating the output you want to run, and then leave it up to Shiny to figure out when to rerun them. Shiny does this by inferring a reactive computation graph for your application and reredenering downstream elements whenever the upstream elements change.\nThis pattern leads to two main benefits for Shiny users:\n\nThe Shiny UI renders extremely efficiently\nYou do not need to explicitly tell Shiny when to rerender things\n\nTo start with we can draw the reactive graph for the application from the previous lesson. This app has two inputs, and three outputs, but the checkbox to add a trndline is only used by one of the outputs.\nFor the purposes of this course we’re going to draw this as a top down Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and put them to the right fo the app:\n\n\n#| standalone: true\n#| components: [editor, viewer]\n#| layout: horizontal\n#| viewerHeight: 800\nfrom shiny import App, render,

through the interaction of this simple app to develop an intuition about how Shiny works. When the app is first rendered Shiny identifies all of the dependencies in the app, to keep track of what needs to change when an input changes. When an input changes downstream elements are invalidated which means that they are flagged for recalculation. Shiny then recalculates each element which needs to be recalculated\n\nUser changes the slider\nWhen the user changes an input, this invalidates any dependencies, which tells Shiny that those dependencies need to be recalculated with the new value.\n\n\n\nSlider changes\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  C[Checkbox] --&gt; Sc((Scatter\\nPlot))\n  Sl --&gt; Sc \n  Sl --&gt; M((Dist Plot))\n  Sl[Slider]:::changed --&gt; T((Table))\n  \n  classDef changed fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecalculate\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  C[Checkbox] --&gt; Sc((Scatter\\nPlot)):::changed\n  Sl --&gt; Sc \n  Sl --&gt; M((Dist Plot)):::changed\n  Sl[Slider] --&gt; T((Table)):::changed\n  \n  classDef changed fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidated\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  C[Checkbox] --&gt; Sc((Scatter\\nPlot)):::changed\n  Sl --&gt; Sc \n  Sl --&gt; M((Dist Plot)):::changed\n  Sl[Slider]:::changed --&gt; T((Table)):::changed\n  \n  classDef changed fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  C[Checkbox] --&gt; Sc((Scatter\\nPlot))\n  Sl --&gt; Sc \n  Sl --&gt; M((Dist Plot))\n  Sl[Slider] --&gt; T((Table))\n  \n  classDef changed fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser changes the checkbox\nWhen the user changes the checkbox the exact same process repeats itself, however, becasue only one output depends on the checkbox, only one element is recalculated.\n\n\n\nSlider changes\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  C[Checkbox]:::changed --&gt; Sc((Scatter\\nPlot))\n  Sl --&gt; Sc \n  Sl --&gt; M((Dist Plot))\n  Sl[Slider] --&gt; T((Table))\n  \n  classDef changed fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecalculate\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  C[Checkbox] --&gt; Sc((Scatter\\nPlot)):::changed\n  Sl --&gt; Sc \n  Sl --&gt; M((Dist Plot))\n  Sl[Slider] --&gt; T((Table))\n  \n  classDef changed fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvalidated\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  C[Checkbox]:::changed --&gt; Sc((Scatter\\nPlot)):::changed\n  Sl --&gt; Sc \n  Sl --&gt; M((Dist Plot))\n  Sl[Slider] --&gt; T((Table))\n  \n  classDef changed fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  C[Checkbox] --&gt; Sc((Scatter\\nPlot))\n  Sl --&gt; Sc \n  Sl --&gt; M((Dist Plot))\n  Sl[Slider] --&gt; T((Table))\n  \n  classDef changed fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simple process of changing inputs, invalidating dependencies, and recaulating values turns out to scale to very complicated applications. As a result it’s worth thinking through the computation graph whenever you’re looking to understand or refactor a shiny application.\n\n\n\nReactive Calculations\nThe penguins application we’ve been working with contains a bit of repetition. Each of the rendering functions contain this code which copies and filters the main dataset:\ndf = penguins.copy()\nfiltered = df.loc[df[\"Body Mass (g)\"] &lt; input.mass()]\nA little bit of repeittion like this is not the end of the world, but Shiny rewards fairly strict adherence to the principle that your code should not repeat itself. The main reason why you be strict about this is that usually repetitive Shiny code will lead to an inefficient final application because a calculation will run more times than it needs to. For example in this app each time we change the filter the dataset is being copied and filtered three times. As your app grows in complexity, or starts executing more intensive computations this repetition will noticibly slow your app down. Reactive calcuations allow you to store the result of a calculation and re-use it across other components. The reactive calculaton is reactive in the sense that it will be invalidated and rerendered just like any other reactive element, and it allows other elements to retrieve the value of that calculation without reexecuting it.\nTo create a reactive calculation, all you do is decorate a function with @reactive.Calc and call it as you would an input object. In this case we create a function called filt_df which contains the filtering logic and call it in the render method with filt_df(). This improves the application both because the filtration logic is kept in one place, and also because it the app UI will not recalculate the value more than necessary.\n  @reactive.Calc\n  def filt_df():\n      df = penguins.copy()\n      filtered = df.loc[df[\"Body Mass (g)\"] &lt; input.mass()]\n      return filtered\n  \n  @output\n  @render.plot\n  def dist():\n      return dist_plot(filt_df())\nAs you can see in the final application, extracting the filtration logic into a reactive hasn’t changed the app behaviour, but has added another node in the computation graph.\n\n\n#| standalone: true\n#| components: [editor, viewer]\n#| layout: horizontal\n#| viewerHeight: 800\nfrom shiny import App, render, ui, reactive\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import

    "text": "2) Locally with VS Code\nWhile Shinylive is great, it likely isn’t the environment you’ll use to develop Shiny apps, and so it makes sense to set up VS Code and run the examples locally. To do this follow these steps before the workshop:\n\nInstall VS Code\nInstall the Shiny for Python VS Code extension\nClone the repository with git clone https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-python-workshop-2023.git, or alternately download the repository as a zip file:\n\nNavigate to the project directory and create a new virtual environment with python3 -m venv .vevn\nSet your python interpreter to the virtual environment with CMD + SHIFT + P &gt; Select Interpreter\nOpen a new terminal prompt, which should switch to (.venv)\nInstall the relevant packages with pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nAll of the example apps are stored in the /apps directory. If you’ve installed the VS Code extention can run any of the apps by opening the app.py file and clicking the play button in the top right. Alternately, run them from the command line with shiny run &lt;path-to-app&gt; --reload."
